# Probability Theory

Probability theory is the mathematical study of randomness and uncertainty. It provides the foundation for statistics, stochastic processes, and many applications in science, engineering, and technology.

## Key Topics

### 1. Basics
- Probability axioms
- Combinatorics
- Conditional probability
- Independence

### 2. Random Variables
- Discrete and continuous random variables
- Expectation and variance
- Moment generating and characteristic functions

### 3. Distributions
- Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson
- Geometric, Negative Binomial
- Uniform, Normal, Exponential
- Other distributions (Beta, Gamma, etc.)

### 4. Limit Theorems
- Law of Large Numbers
- Central Limit Theorem

### 5. Inequalities
- Markov and Chebyshev inequalities
- Other inequalities (Jensen's, Holder's, etc.)

### 6. Applications
- Bayes' theorem
- Simulation examples
- Real-world problems
- Specializations: human eye, nanotechnology, etc.
